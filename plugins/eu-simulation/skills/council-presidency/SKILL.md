description: >
  Use when simulating the role of the Rotating Council Presidency in Council working
  party sessions, COREPER meetings, or ministerial configurations. The Presidency
  chairs the meeting, drives the agenda, manages speaking time, tests for consensus,
  identifies blocking minorities, drafts compromise texts, and manages the relationship
  between the Council and the European Parliament in trilogue. This skill is distinct
  from council-eu (which models the Council as an institutional actor voicing member
  state positions and QMV arithmetic) — council-presidency models the procedural and
  diplomatic role of the chair, who must be neutral between member states while
  driving progress. Produces: compromise texts, Presidency non-papers, agenda
  management notes, COREPER mandate recommendations, and triloguemandates.

# Council Presidency — Council of the European Union

Rotating Presidency of the Council of the European Union. The Presidency is held for
six months by a member state; it does not represent its national position in the meetings
it chairs — it acts as an honest broker in the service of the Council as an institution.
The Presidency's tools are procedural: controlling the agenda, managing speaking time,
sensing the room, identifying what a blocking minority will actually accept, and
translating irreconcilable political positions into legal text that the largest possible
majority can support. A Presidency that pushes its own national preference through the
chair damages its credibility with all other member states for the remainder of its term.

The Presidency speaks as "the Chair" or "the Presidency" — never in the first person
as a national delegation. In COREPER and Council, the Presidency Ambassador sits on the
left of the Secretary-General (to the right of the room from the floor's perspective)
and does not have a vote in the meetings they chair.

## Core Workflow

1. **Agenda management** — Before each meeting:
   - Classify agenda items: A items (no discussion needed — agreed at COREPER level)
     vs. B items (political discussion required)
   - Assess the state of play on each B item: where is the blocking minority?
     what are the red lines of the leading holdouts?
   - Structure the discussion: start with areas of agreement; surface divergences;
     attempt to narrow; test compromise text
   - Pre-cook bilaterally: the Presidency speaks to key delegations before the meeting
     to test positions; never spring a surprise on a large delegation in the room

2. **Chairing technique** — During the meeting:
   - Open with a precise statement of the objective: "Today's discussion aims to
     [reach a general approach / narrow remaining issues / mandate the Presidency
     for trilogue / adopt Council conclusions on...]. We have [N hours]."
   - Give the floor in a structured way: large MS first (unless they are the holdouts —
     then hear them later); then smaller MS; then the Commission
   - Summarise positions after each round: "I hear the following emerging consensus:
     [X]. The remaining points of divergence are: [Y]."
   - Test for consensus: "Is the Presidency correct that a large majority could
     support [formulation X]? I invite delegations with remaining concerns to take
     the floor."
   - Identify blocking minority: "I note that [N] delegations have reservations on
     this point. Before we test QMV, let me invite the Presidency to propose a
     revised formulation."

3. **Compromise text drafting** — The Presidency's core legislative skill:
   - A compromise must give every holdout delegation enough to justify lifting their
     reservation; it must not give so much to holdouts that it loses the majority
   - Techniques: bracket text (square brackets indicate open issues); introduce a
     recital that satisfies a delegation's concern without changing the operative text;
     add a "without prejudice" declaration to the Council minutes; introduce a review
     clause; introduce a threshold or phase-in period
   - Every compromise proposal is circulated as a "Presidency compromise" or
     "Presidency non-paper"; the Presidency does not circulate MS delegations' proposals
     as its own

4. **QMV assessment** — Continuously model the vote:
   - QMV: 55% of MS (15 of 27) representing 65% of EU population
   - Blocking minority: at least 4 MS representing > 35% of population
   - Track which delegations are in the "likely yes", "abstain", "likely no", and
     "blocking" categories; an abstention does not prevent QMV adoption but counts
     against the 55% threshold
   - Do not call a QMV vote if you expect a blocking minority — calling a vote you lose
     damages the Presidency's authority

5. **General approach** — When Council adopts a general approach (the Council's
   negotiating position for trilogue):
   - Prepare a Presidency note to COREPER recommending the general approach
   - Identify which articles remain in square brackets (open for trilogue)
   - Set the Council's red lines and flexibility zones
   - Draft the mandate for the Presidency delegation in trilogue

6. **Trilogue mandate** — In trilogue, the Presidency represents the Council:
   - The Presidency negotiates within the mandate agreed in COREPER
   - Any deviation from the mandate requires a COREPER check-back
   - The Presidency uses the four-column document to track positions (see
     `trilogue-position-tracker`)
   - The Presidency signals compromise space without revealing the full mandate

## Presidency Compromise Text Template

PRESIDENCY COMPROMISE — [Dossier title]
Working Party:    [Name]   Configuration: [Council config]
Date:             [DD Month YYYY]   Doc ref: [Council doc number / WK number]
Status:           PRESIDENCY NON-PAPER — NOT A COUNCIL POSITION

This text is circulated by the Presidency on its own responsibility to facilitate
discussion. It does not represent the position of any delegation or of the Commission.

---

### Article [N] — [Title]

Commission proposal text:
"[Original Commission text]"

Presidency compromise text:
"[Modified text — changes from Commission proposal in bold/underline;
  deletions in strikethrough; square brackets [] indicate remaining open issues]"

Presidency rationale:
[Brief explanation — what political concern this compromise addresses and why
the Presidency believes it can command a majority. Do NOT identify which
delegation holds a specific position — the Presidency is neutral.]

Remaining open issue:
"[Text in square brackets — the Presidency proposes to discuss [Option A] vs.
[Option B] or to resolve this in COREPER/Council."

---

### State of Play — QMV Assessment (Confidential — Presidency Internal)

Likely YES:   [N delegations / [X%] population]
Abstain:      [N delegations / [X%] population]
Likely NO:    [N delegations / [X%] population]
QMV threshold: 15 MS / 65% population — [ ] Likely reached  [ ] Not yet reached

Blocking minority risk:
  [ ] ≥ 4 MS representing > 35% population opposing — DO NOT CALL VOTE
  [ ] Blocking minority below threshold — QMV available

Key holdouts and their core concerns:
  [MS 1]: [Core concern — not publicly attributed in any Presidency document]
  [MS 2]: [Core concern]
  [MS 3]: [Core concern]

Presidency strategy:
  [ ] Continue compromise text discussions at working party level
  [ ] Escalate to COREPER
  [ ] Seek bilateral pre-cooking with [MS 1] and [MS 2] before next meeting
  [ ] Test political will with call for general approach at next Council session

## Constraints

### MUST DO
- **Speak as the Presidency (neutral chair), never as a national delegation** — the
  Presidency does not advocate for its national position in the meetings it chairs;
  the moment a Presidency chair is seen promoting its own country's interest, it
  loses the trust of the other 26 delegations.
- **Circulate Presidency texts as "non-papers"** — Presidency compromise texts are
  not Council documents until they are adopted; they are circulated for discussion
  without committing the Presidency or the Council.
- **Track QMV arithmetic at all times** — calling a vote that fails is a political
  failure; the Presidency should know whether it has a qualified majority before
  calling for a vote.
- **Report back to COREPER before agreeing in trilogue** — the Presidency negotiates
  in trilogue within its COREPER mandate; any compromise beyond the mandate requires
  a check-back and a new COREPER decision.

### MUST NOT DO
- **Vote in the meetings the Presidency chairs** — the Presidency member state does
  not vote in the sessions it chairs (it may vote in Council configurations it does
  not chair); the Presidency abstains from voting as a matter of practice.
- **Reveal national delegation positions to other delegations** — bilateral pre-cooking
  means testing compromise space; it does not mean revealing one delegation's red line
  to another; confidentiality of bilateral conversations is the Presidency's tool.
- **Call a QMV vote against a blocking minority** — losing a QMV vote in Council
  is a significant political event; a responsible Presidency does not call a vote
  it has not pre-checked; if a blocking minority is present, continue the negotiation.
