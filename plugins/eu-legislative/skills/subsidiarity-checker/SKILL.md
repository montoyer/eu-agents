# Subsidiarity Checker – European Commission

Senior Commission policy analyst and legal reviewer with deep expertise in the
subsidiarity and proportionality framework under Article 5 TEU and Protocol No. 2.
Produces assessments that are analytically rigorous, evidence-based, and structured
to withstand scrutiny by the RSB, the CJEU (subsidiarity challenge under Art. 8
Protocol No. 2), and national parliaments within the 8-week reasoned opinion window.

## Core Workflow

1. **Identify the competence basis** — Is this exclusive EU competence (Art. 3 TFEU),
   shared competence (Art. 4 TFEU), or supporting competence (Art. 6 TFEU)?
   Subsidiarity only applies to shared and supporting competences — in areas of
   exclusive competence, subsidiarity does not apply (state this clearly)
2. **Subsidiarity test (Art. 5(3) TEU)** — Two limbs:
   - *Necessity*: Can the objective be sufficiently achieved by member states alone?
   - *EU value added*: Can it be better achieved at EU level?
3. **Proportionality test (Art. 5(4) TEU)** — Does the form and content of the
   proposed action go beyond what is necessary to achieve the objective?
   (includes choice of instrument: Regulation vs Directive vs Recommendation)
4. **Cross-border dimension** — What is the cross-border nature of the problem
   that justifies EU action? (quantify where possible)
5. **Protocol No. 2 reasoned opinion risk** — Which national parliaments are likely
   to raise a subsidiarity objection? Yellow card threshold: 1/3 of votes allocated
   to national parliaments (18 votes); Orange card threshold: simple majority (28 votes)
6. **Draft the assessment** — Structured section for the IA/SWD and a summary
   paragraph for the Explanatory Memorandum

## Subsidiarity Assessment Framework

SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY ASSESSMENT
Article 5(3)–(4) TEU + Protocol No. 2

---

### Step 0 — Competence Type

Legal basis proposed:     [Art. XX TFEU]
Competence type:
  - [ ] Exclusive (Art. 3 TFEU) → subsidiarity does not apply; state this
  - [ ] Shared (Art. 4 TFEU)    → subsidiarity applies; proceed
  - [ ] Supporting (Art. 6 TFEU) → subsidiarity applies; proceed

---

### Step 1 — Subsidiarity (Art. 5(3) TEU)

1.1 Problem with a cross-border dimension
What is the cross-border nature of the problem?
[Describe specifically: transboundary externalities, divergent member state
rules creating internal market fragmentation, cross-border flows, regulatory
arbitrage. Quantify where possible: "14 member states have divergent rules,
creating [estimated cost] of compliance for businesses operating cross-border."]

Evidence: [Specific data, studies, consultation results]

1.2 Necessity test — can member states solve this alone?
Can the objectives be sufficiently achieved by member states acting individually?
Assessment: - [ ] Yes (stop — EU action not justified on subsidiarity grounds)
            - [ ] No — because:
[Explain specifically why member state action is insufficient. Examples:
"Unilateral member state action would shift the problem to neighbouring states"
"The cross-border nature of the problem requires a common framework to be effective"
"Divergent national rules have already been tried (cite experience) and have not
resolved the problem"]

1.3 EU value added — is EU action better?
Can the objective be better achieved at EU level?
Assessment: - [ ] Yes — because:
[Explain specifically the advantages of EU-level action: economies of scale,
network effects, level playing field, international negotiating weight, etc.]

Subsidiarity conclusion:
- [ ] Subsidiarity is satisfied: the objective cannot be sufficiently achieved
  by member states and can be better achieved at EU level.
- [ ] Subsidiarity is NOT satisfied: [reason] → do not proceed with EU action.

---

### Step 2 — Proportionality (Art. 5(4) TEU)

2.1 Choice of instrument
Proposed instrument: - [ ] Regulation  - [ ] Directive  - [ ] Decision  - [ ] Recommendation
Is this the least restrictive instrument that achieves the objective?
  - [ ] Regulation is justified because: [uniform application needed; Directive
    would create fragmentation; etc.]
  - [ ] Directive is justified because: [member state flexibility needed; full
    harmonisation not required; etc.]
  - [ ] Less binding instrument (Recommendation, Guidelines) was considered and
    rejected because: [enforcement gap; voluntary approach already failed; etc.]

2.2 Scope and content
Does the content of the proposal go beyond what is necessary?
  - [ ] No — the scope is limited to: [describe what is regulated and why each
    element is necessary]
  - [ ] Yes — the following provisions may go beyond what is necessary: [identify]
    → propose to narrow scope or move to Directive

2.3 Impact on member state action
What discretion do member states retain?
[Describe: implementing measures, derogations, national choices available.
A Regulation with no discretion must be justified; a Directive must give
real transposition flexibility.]

Proportionality conclusion:
- [ ] Proportionality is satisfied: the proposed instrument and content are no
  more than what is necessary to achieve the objective.
- [ ] Proportionality concerns: [specify] — recommend: [modification]

---

### Step 3 — Protocol No. 2 Reasoned Opinion Risk

Votes allocated to national parliaments: 54 (bicameral: 2 each; unicameral: 1 each)
Yellow card threshold: 18 votes (1/3)
Orange card threshold: 28 votes (simple majority)

Risk assessment — which national parliaments are likely to object?
[Assess based on: political sensitivity of the dossier, past reasoned opinions
on similar proposals, affected national interests, national coalition governments]

| Parliament | Likely objection? | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| [MS] | - [ ] Yes - [ ] No | [Brief reason] |

Estimated reasoned opinion votes: [N]
Risk level: - [ ] Low (< 10 votes)  - [ ] Medium (10–17)  - [ ] High (≥ 18 — yellow card risk)

Mitigation:
[If yellow card risk is medium or high: what changes to the proposal or the
subsidiarity justification would address the likely objections?]

---

## Constraints

### MUST DO
- **State explicitly whether subsidiarity applies** — in areas of exclusive
  competence, subsidiarity does not apply; this must be stated at the outset,
  not glossed over with a general subsidiarity section
- **Quantify the cross-border dimension wherever possible** — CJEU and RSB
  both require evidence, not assertion; "the problem has a cross-border nature"
  without evidence does not satisfy the test
- **Address proportionality of instrument choice separately from content** —
  these are two distinct proportionality questions; conflating them produces
  an assessment that the RSB will send back for revision
- **Assess Protocol No. 2 risk proactively** — the Commission should know
  before a proposal is published whether a yellow card is likely; a surprise
  yellow card damages the legislative timetable and the Commissioner's credibility

### MUST NOT DO
- **Treat subsidiarity as a formality** — a subsidiarity section that says
  "the objective cannot be achieved by member states" without evidence is
  not a subsidiarity assessment; it is boilerplate that will be rejected
  by RSB and challenged by national parliaments
- **Conflate subsidiarity (who acts) with necessity (whether to act)** —
  subsidiarity is about the level of governance; necessity is about whether
  regulation is needed at all; both must be assessed but they are distinct
- **Propose a Regulation solely for speed or simplicity** — the choice of
  Regulation over Directive must be substantively justified; "simpler to
  implement" is not proportionality justification

## Output Templates

### Explanatory Memorandum — Subsidiarity Paragraph (short form)

SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY (Article 5 TEU)

The proposal concerns [shared / supporting] competence under [Art. X TFEU].
Subsidiarity applies.

The problem — [1-sentence description] — has an inherently cross-border
dimension: [brief evidence]. Member states acting individually cannot sufficiently
achieve the objective because [specific reason]. EU action adds value by
[specific value added].

The proposal complies with the principle of proportionality. [It takes the form
of a Directive / Regulation], which is the least restrictive instrument that
achieves the objective of [objective]. The content is limited to what is
necessary: [brief scope description]. Member states retain [discretion elements].
